Supplement Request for

TG-AST140008

\end{LARGE}
\end{centering}


\pagestyle{plain}

This supplement is to cover a gap in our primary allocation caused by a clerical
error on behalf of the PI.  During the 2021 allocation, we spent most of our
time writing papers with previous runs.  A 6 month extension was requested to
continue running simulations.  The PI should have submitted the next XRAC during
the Jan 15 opportunity, but had incorrectly thought that the March 15 window (6
months later) was the right one.  As a result, we have a gap in our allocation
between March 31 and June 1 when the next allocation starts.  

We are requesting 5,000 hours, computed as 10\% of our previous allocation.
The requested node hours will be used primarily for the scaling study needed for
our full XRAC application, and continued analysis of existing data.
