\section{Computational Method}
\label{sec.method}

For the proposed simulations, we will use Enzo \citep{Collins10, Bryan14}.  Enzo
is an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code, which dynamically adds resolution
elements as the simulation evolves.  (Magneto)ydrodynamics is solved on an Eulerian grid
using finite volume techniques.  AMR is a technique that dynamically adds
resolution elements to the flow as it evolves.  

For hydrodynamics we use the
piecewise parabolic method \citep{Colella84}, and we use a piecewise linear
method for MHD \citep{Li08a}.  The AMR uses the scheme of \citet{Berger89}, and
the MHD uses the scheme of \citet{Balsara01}.  Gravity is solved with fast
Fourier transforms on the root grid, and multi-grid relaxation on the sub-grid
patches \citep{Bryan14}.  

The \nameTurbulence, \nameCores, and  \nameCMB\ simulations use an isothermal
equation of state.  Heating and cooling for the \nameGalaxies\ simulations will
be handled with the package Grackle \citep{Smith17}.

Turbulent driving in the \nameTurbulence\ and \nameCMB\ simulations will be
done by adding a large-scale random velocity field at every time step, with the
velocity field evolving using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process \citep{Schmidt09}.
