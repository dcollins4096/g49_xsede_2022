\section{Computational Method}
\label{sec.method}

For the proposed simulations, we will use Enzo \citep{Collins10, Bryan14}.  Enzo
is an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code, which dynamically adds resolution
elements as the simulation evolves.  (Magneto)ydrodynamics is solved on an Eulerian grid
using finite volume techniques.  Specifically, for hydrodynamics we use the
piecewise parabolic method \citep{Colella84}, and we use a piecewise linear
method for MHD \citep{Li08a}.  The AMR uses the scheme of \citet{Berger89}, and
the MHD uses the scheme of \citet{Balsara01}.  Gravity is solved with fast
Fourier transforms on the root grid, and multi-grid relaxation on the sub-grid
patches \citep{Bryan14}.  
The \nameTurbulence, \nameCores, and  \nameCMB\ simulations use an isothermal
equation of state.  Heating and cooling for the \nameGalaxies\ simulations will
be handled with the package Grackle \citep{Smith17}.
Turbulent driving in the \nameTurbulence\ and \nameCMB\ simulations will be
done by adding a large-scale random velocity field at every time step, with the
velocity field evolving using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process \citep{Schmidt09}.
