Turbulence underpins all of the projects in this proposal, the first two most
notably.  Here we describe the aspects of a turbulent system that impact the
design of our simulations, the excellent work of \citet{Frisch95} has more
details.

In a turbulent system, energy is injected at a scale, $L_{driving}$.  By way of
fluid instabilities, the energy cascades to smaller and smaller scales until
molecular interactions dissipate the energy at a scale $L_{diss}$.  This causes the spectrum of energy
to behave like a powerlaw, $E(k)=k^{a}$.  For incompressible fluid turbulence,
$a=-5/3$, but that exponent varies with the inclusion of supersonic
(compressible) flow and magnetic fields.  The region between
$L_{driving}$ and $L_{diss}$, where the powerlaw is valid, is referred to as
the \emph{inertial range}.  Here, the nonlinear inertial terms in the
Navier-Stokes equation dominate over the dissipation terms, and it is the
behavior of the nonlinear terms that we wish to explore.  $L_{driving}$ is set
by the boundary of the simulation. $L_{diss}$ is set by details of the
solver and the energy of the flow.  Thus, for a given driving energy, the only
way to increase the size of the inertial range is with resolution.  The
inclusion of magnetic fields only shrinks the inertial range.

At a resolution of $256^3$, the driving scale and dissipation scale overlap, and
there is not much inertial range to work with.  At $512^3$, an inertial range
appears, but it is small, and determining the actual powerlaw portion of the
spectrum is error-prone.  At $1024^3$, a reasonable powerlaw appears even for
magnetized simulations.  Further increase of the resolution is desirable, but
the cost scales like the number of zones on a side to the fourth power, while
the size of the inertial range is only linear.  Increases in resolution to
$2048^3$ and beyond is possible and desirable, but also quite costly in terms of
total $SU$, disk, and human time.  This will be explored if the results of the
current proposal indicate it is necessary.  

Turbulence is a chaotic process, and must be handled statistically.  A single
snapshot from a turbulent box is largely random, the true nature must be
averaged over a window of time.  Additionally, we focus on fully developed
turbulence, which takes some simulation time to develop.  

For the \nameCMB\ and \nameTurbulence simulations, we will use a resolution of $1024^3$ to
obtain inertial ranges that are well defined.  For the \nameCores\ suite, we
will use a root grid of $512^3$ to offset the cost of 4 levels of AMR and
gravity.  The
\nameGalaxies\ will use a root grid of $256^3$ and 8 levels of AMR-- properly
resolving the turbulence in the galaxy as well as the circumgalactic media is
presently impossible.  Simulation design will be described further in the next
sections.
