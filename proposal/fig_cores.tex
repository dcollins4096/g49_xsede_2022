\caption[ ]{The collapse of several neighboring cores.  (Left) The initial
positions of the cores along each axis (3a-3c) and the y-coordinate vs. time
(3d).  (Right) A projection of the domain, showing these cores as well as
several others. Different cores begin as fractal objects, intertwined with one
another.}
