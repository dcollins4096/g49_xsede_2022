\caption{Summary of allocation request. The total node hours and disk usage
are in the first two columns, broken down by project. The physics packages used in
eash project  determine the cost and scalability. $N_{sim}$ is the number of simulations
in the suite, some of which may run concurrently.
$N_N$, is in the number of nodes to be used.  64 cores per node will be used
for all simulations.
