    \caption{Summary of allocation request. The total node hours and disk usage
    are in the first two columns, broken down by project. The physics packages used in
    eash project and
    adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) structure determine the cost per zone-update,
    \suzu\ for each simulation suite.  The number of nodes, $N_N$, is in the
    last column.
