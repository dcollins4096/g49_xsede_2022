\caption{Allocation request.  Cost for each simulation, $SU$, is computed from
wall time and number of nodes for each suite, per Equations \ref{eqn.twall},
\ref{eqn.su}.  $T_{wall}$ is measured in hours, the number of nodes for each
suite can be found
in Table \ref{table1}.
The \nameTurbulence\ and \nameCMB\ suites are
itemized by Mach number and \alf\ Mach number, $M_s$ and $M_a$,
which affect the total time, T, and timestep size $\Delta T$.  
The AMR simulations, \nameCores\ and \nameGalaxies\, is are itemized for a
single simulation by level, $\ell$, and the cost is found by estimating the
volume fraction, $f_\ell$, covered on level and the
time step $\Delta t$ for that level.  The \nameCores\ and \nameGalaxies\
simulations are repeated 3 and 2 times.  Long term disk usage is estimated as $N_Z$
    times the number of fields for each simulation.  More details are given in
    the text. }
