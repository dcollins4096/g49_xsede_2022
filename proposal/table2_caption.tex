\caption{Allocation request.  Cost for each simulation, $SU$, is computed from
the cost per zone-update, $\suzu$, the number of zones $N_Z$, and the number of
timesteps $N_U$.
For the \nameTurbulence\ and \nameCMB\ suites, the
simulations are itemized by Mach number and \alf\ Mach number, $M_s$ and $M_a$,
which affect the total time, T, and timestep size $\Delta T$.  
The cost of the AMR simulations, \nameCores\ and \nameGalaxies\, is estimated
for each level, $\ell$, by estimating the volume fraction, $f_\ell$, covered on level
    $\ell$, time step $\Delta t$.  Long term disk usage is estimated as $N_Z$
    times the number of fields for each simulation.  More details are given in
    the text }
