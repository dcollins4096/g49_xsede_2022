\section{Access to Other Computational Resources}

{\bf Local Computing Environment}  
The astrophysics group at Florida State
University has a small cluster with 300 cores.  This machine is useful for
testing and debugging, but not large enough for the proposed simulations.
Florida State University also maintains a research cluster, but it is also
insufficient for this research.


\noindent{\bf Other supercomputing resources.}  The PI of the current proposal
does not presently have access to other supercomputing resources.
